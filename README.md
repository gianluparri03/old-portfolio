# gianluparri03.github.io

In this repo you can see the source code for my portfolio (available at [gianluparri03.github.io](https://gianluparri03.github.io)) that I created for my own.

For this project I used:
- Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) ([Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) and [Literata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata))

I also took ispiration from the "[github](https://github.com) style".
